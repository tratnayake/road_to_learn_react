componentWillReceiveProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
componentWillUpdate()
render()
componentDidUpdate()

constructor(props) - called when a component is initialized.
-- Set initial state and bind useful methods here

componentWillMount() - Called before render. Could be used to set internal component state.

render() -- returns elements as output of component (Don't modify state in here)

componentDidMount() - Called only once when the comp is mounted.
** -- This is a good time to fetch data form API. This data gets stored in internal state.

componentWIllReceiveProps(nextProps) - Called during an update.

shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) -- Called when the component updates due ot state or props changes
-- Used for perf optimizations

componentWillUpdate(nextProp,nextState) -- Immediately invoked before render() method.
-- You can't use setState() from in here, use this for final prep of data

componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) - Called immediately after render. Use this as opp to change DOM or fetch more

componentWillUnmount() - Called before destroying component.
